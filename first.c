/*first the .c exetension is imp for the complier to recognise it,
next: The program is first given to a preprocessor, which obeys commands that begin with # (known as directives).
A preprocessor is a bit like an editor; it can add things to the program and make modifications
next: The modified program now goes to a compiler, which translates it into machine instructions (object code).
The program isnâ€™t quite ready to run yet, however.
In the final step, a linker combines the object code produced by the compiler with any additional code needed to yield a complete executable program.
This additional code includes library functions (like printf) that are used in the program.*/

// In this whole course, i will be using gcc to compile, we can add a flag to make things more understand able, 
// i.e -o flag, syantx: gcc file_name.c -o file_name, this creates a executable file with the same name as of the file, instead of a.exe


// most programs follow a general template,
/*
directives
int main(void)
{
	statements;
}
