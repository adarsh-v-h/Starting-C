/*first the .c exetension is imp for the complier to recognise it,
next: The program is first given to a preprocessor, which obeys commands that begin with # (known as directives).
A preprocessor is a bit like an editor; it can add things to the program and make modifications
next: The modified program now goes to a compiler, which translates it into machine instructions (object code).
The program isnâ€™t quite ready to run yet, however.
In the final step, a linker combines the object code produced by the compiler with any additional code needed to yield a complete executable program.
This additional code includes library functions (like printf) that are used in the program.*/

// In this whole course, i will be using gcc to compile, we can add a flag to make things more understand able, 
// i.e -o flag, syantx: gcc file_name.c -o file_name, this creates a executable file with the same name as of the file, instead of a.exe


// most programs follow a general template,
/*
directives
int main(void)
{
	statements;
}
*/
// in the printf func we used \n to move to new line, cause printf by itself doesnt do that, and also we can use \t for tab, \b backspace, \" to use quotations and \\ to use the backslash...
// there are many more but these are the most used..
