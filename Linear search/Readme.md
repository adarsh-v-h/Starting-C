So i started with basic linear search, then tried to optimize with various ways, the first was moving the recently accessed element to first possition, then was moving the accessed element 1 step closer to the start of the array and the last was the fastest(only use for large data), we use multiple threads and divide the array into chucks and assign each chunk to a thread, then we get result from all the threads...
I learnt how we can do proper linear search and we can use threads..
we used the library pthread, which is not installed by defaut in windows, if you are using mingw to compile the code, you install it in "mingw install manager".. and while running you have add the flag "-lpthread" at the end of your command(ex: gcc -o file file.c -lpthread)...
