Starting C, even tho i have still not completed my rust and python Backend, i want to learn C to understand more of hardware and its interaction with software, and there is no better lang than C (maybe assembly too, but i aint that unstable yet), so will be learing C from the classic C book for unix systems.
so because of time being less and while the C from the book is mostly for unix, about which i dont have any knowledge of, it was hard to continue there, so i am continuing with a 5 hours youtube course by Boot dev, as C prg and memory management.
